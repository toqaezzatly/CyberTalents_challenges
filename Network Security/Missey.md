## üß© Challenge Overview

Our Network Monitoring System (NMS) flagged suspicious traffic coming from IP `192.168.1.7`. You‚Äôre tasked with analyzing the captured network traffic (`Missey.pcap`) and identifying any anomalies‚Äîpossibly brute-force activity‚Äîand uncovering a hidden flag.

---



## üîç Step-by-Step Analysis

### üîπ Step 1: Filter the Suspect Traffic

We start by isolating only the packets where the suspected attacker (`192.168.1.7`) is the source, and the destination is in the suspicious external IP range (`192.126.117.0/24`):

```bash
tshark -r Missey.pcap -Y "ip.src==192.168.1.7 && ip.dst >= 192.126.117.0 && ip.dst <= 192.126.117.255" -T fields -e tcp.payload > bruteforce.txt
```

**Breakdown:**

* `-r Missey.pcap`: Read the packet capture.
* `-Y`: Apply a **display filter** (as used in Wireshark GUI).
* `ip.src == ... && ip.dst == ...`: Focus only on brute-force attempts to external IPs.
* `-T fields -e tcp.payload`: Extract just the TCP payload (likely to include brute-force attempts).
* `> bruteforce.txt`: Save it for post-analysis.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Decode the Extracted Payload (Double Decoding)

The extracted data in `bruteforce.txt` is **hex-encoded**. To convert it into readable ASCII, we used a **two-step decoding** using `xxd`:

```bash
cat bruteforce.txt | xxd -r -p | xxd -r -p
```

**Why decode twice?**

* The first `xxd -r -p` turns hex into **raw bytes**.
* But those raw bytes themselves are hex strings again (e.g., `"464c4147..."` ‚Üí `"FLAG..."`).
* So we apply `xxd -r -p` **again** to finally decode the actual message.

---

### üîπ Step 3: Finding the Flag

After decoding, we found a readable string:

```
FLAG{M15SED_INBY73$3}
```

But here‚Äôs the catch: the last `3` was **outside the flag format** and caused submission errors.

---

### üîπ Step 4: Fix the Flag Format

To fix it:

* Manually remove the stray character (`3`), likely caused by trailing junk bytes or TCP fragmentation.
* This gives us the correct flag:

```
FLAG{M15SED_INBY73$}
```

---

## üß† Analysis ‚Äì Why the ‚Äú3‚Äù Was There?

* It‚Äôs **not part of the actual flag**.
* Likely an **extra byte** in the payload or leftover from TCP segmentation.
* Always visually verify the string and **clean up any artifacts** before submitting.

## ‚úÖ Final Flag

```
FLAG{M15SED_INBY73$}
```

## üß™ Bonus Tip

If you ever see this kind of **double-encoded hex**, try a nested decoding strategy. You can automate this by checking if the decoded string is still valid hex before re-decoding.
